#FuncJS Quick Introduction
FuncJS is a simple JavaScript library which packs __great__ functions, to help you become more efficient.

## What is FuncJS?
FuncJS (abbreviation for *Functions-JavaScript*) is a new JavaScript library, which packs **23** pre-written functions, which are easy to understand and at the same time are very powerful in the way they work. Basic functions, such as <code>echo()</code> let's you display text on-screen very quickly, while <code>findLinks()</code> saves you the time of having to search a string for any links. While other JavaScript libraries, such as *jQuery*, are very, very powerful in the way they work, FuncJS doesn't aim to reach that level and is there as a lightweight quick solution, for all those basic tasks completed. 

##Interesting, where can I get a hold of FuncJS?
Right here, on Github. Simply download the files from this repository and include it in any of your webpages via the script tag, as you normally would with any other JavaScript library. There's a great documentation web app that's available at [http://docs.funcjs.webege.com](http://docs.funcjs.webege.com/) which details each and every one of FuncJS's function's in-depth on its own page, and is **constantly** updated with content if any are to occur. 

That's all, and happy JavaScripting!
